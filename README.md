# Exploratory_Data_Proj1

My overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. My task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

The plots of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are under issues.
The code for plot1, 2, 3, and 4 are in this repositary.
